<span id="beliefs">OUR BELIEFS</span>
<br>
<br>
1.The SCRIPTURE INSPIRED We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God,the infallible and final rule of faith and conduct. ( 2 Tim.3;16, 2 Peter 1;21)
<br>
<br>
2.The ONE TRUE GOD We believe in one triune God,eternally existing in three Divine Persons (Father,Son and the Holy Spirit) co-eternal in being,co-identical in nature,co-equal in power and glory possessing the same attributes and perfection. (Deut.6;4,Matt.28;l9,2 Cor.13;14,Matt.3;16-17,John 14;16,23, Lk3;21-22,Jn.4;23)
<br>
<br>
3.The FALL OF MAN We believe that God created man pure and upright but by voluntary transgression man fell.Through Adam’s,the whole human race fell and inherited a sinful nature alienated from God.Man himself is utterly unable to remedy his lost condition. (Gen.1;26-27, Gen.3, Eph 2;1-3, Rom.5;12, Rom 3;22-23)
<br>
<br>
4.The SALVATION OF MAN We believe that salvation is a free gift from God made available through His grace apart from meritorious works of sinful men and must be personally appropriated by faith in Jesus Christ. (Eph.2;8-9, Jn. 1;12, Jn 3;16, Ac.4;12, Rom.4;4-5, Gal.2;16)
<br>
<br>
5.SANCTIFICATION We believe that the Bible clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion for the flesh.Holiness of life and conduct in obedience to God’s commandments should be practiced by believer. (I Pet. 1;14-16, Rom.8;12, Rom.6;11-13, Rom 13;13-14,Gal.5;13, Tit.2;11,I Jn 2;6)
<br>
<br>
6.The CHURCH ; A). MISSION We believe that the Church,which is the body and espoused Bride of Christ,is a spiritual organism made up of born again believers.That the continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures. (Eph.1;22-23, 5;22-27, I Cor.12;12-14, Acts 14;27 II Cor 1;1,Rev.19;7, I Tim 3;1-13, Titus 1;5-11, Acts 2;47)
<br>
<br>
B). ORDINANCES We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ left two ordinances to be observed by the local church in commemoration of His person and work;
<br>
<br>
1).Baptism in Water- Baptism by immersion,in the name of the Father,Son and Holy Spirit.We practice water baptism as an outward sign of an inner work whereby the believer identifies himself with Christ in His death,burial and resurrection.Dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God in newness of life. (Matt.28;19, Rom.6;3-4,11, Acts 2;41)
<br>
<br>
2).The Partaking of the Lord’s Supper- Bread and grape juice are used as symbols and taken as a memorial of the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. (I Cor.11;23-26, Mk.14;22-24, Matt 26;26-28)
<br>
<br>
7.The BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT We believe in the baptism in (or with) the Holy Spirit,which is generally witnessed by the initial physical evidence of speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance.That all believers are entitled to and should earnestly seek the promise of the Father,the endowment of power for life and service.That,this experience is distinct and subsequent to the experience of the New Birth. 8.DIVINE HEALING We believe that Divine Healing is the power of the Lord Jesus Christ to heal the sick and afflicted in answer to believing prayer,that He who is the same yesterday,today and forever has never changed but is still an all-sufficient help in time of trouble,able to meet the needs of,and quicken into newness of life,the body,as well as the soul and spirit,in answer to faith of them who ever pray with submission to His divine and sovereign will.
<br>
<br>
9.The BLESSED HOPE We believe in the sure return of our Lord Jesus Christ to establish His kingdom on earth,that His coming will be literal,bodily,personal and visible as His going away in Acts 1;9.That the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ for His bride,the Church,constitute the “Blessed Hope” for which the saints should constantly look for; (Matt. 24;27,30,44, Jn 14;1-3, I Thess 1;10, 4;13-17, Titus 2;13)
<br>
<br>
10.JUDGEMENT OF THE SAINTS We believe that saints will appear before the Judgement Seat of Christ not to receive condemnation of their works but to receive what is due to him for the things done while in this body. (Rom 14;10, 2 Cor.5;10, I Cor 3;10-14)
<br>
<br>
11.TRIBULATION We believe that in between the time of Christ’s coming for His bride (the Church) and His return in judgement,there will be a Great Tribulation where a time of distress which has never been experienced before and never to be equaled with anything yet to come,will be poured out unto this earth as manifestations of God’s wrath and judgement. (Matt.24;21, Rev.6;8,9,16, Mk.13;19, Lk 21;5-32, Dan 12;1, I Thess 5;9,Dan 9;24-27, 12;1)
<br>
<br>
12.The MILLENIAL REIGN OF CHRIST We believe in the millennial reign of Christ.The literal reign of Jesus here on earth for 1,000 years as fulfillment of prophecy. (2 Thess 1;7, Rev.1;11-18, Rom 11;26, Rev.20;1-7)
<br>
<br>
13.The LAKE OF FIRE We believe that the devil and his angels,the beast and the false prophets,and whosoever’s name is not found in the Book of Life shall be consigned to everlasting punishment in the Lake of Fire which is called the second death. (Rev. 20;10-14, 21;6, Rev.19;20, Matt.25;41, Matt;3;21, Mk.9;43-45, Lk 3;17).
<br>
<br>
14.The NEW HEAVEN AND EARTH We believe that God will create new heaven and new earth wherein only the righteous will finally dwell. (2 Pet.3;13, Rev.21;1-3, Isa.65;17, Heb.11;8-10, 13,14,16, Heb.12;22-28)
