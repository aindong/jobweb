			Wonderful greetings to all believers, fellow workers, families and friends! It’s amazing that God put us together in the body of Christ.
			<br>
			<br>
			It is a plan, goal and desire to put all in our minds and hearts together that  we will be able to show that we have one “Call” ever that we maybe. I want to send a message regardless of the global crisis in all aspects of life, the acts of terrorism, worldwide economic crisis, natural disaster and most of all, spiritual diversity as viewed by liberalism and conservatism. In this regard, many were confused in their directions. However, I just want the people of God to focus in His word that His assurance is with us, he loves us and He cares for us. “God is our refuge and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble” (Psalm 46:1). Serving God is not easy as we think; I cannot imagine how God turn things around from all trials and hardships but without a doubt, we all know that God is able!
			<br>
			<br>
			I also give thanks to God for the work that He has been doing for us here in America, our volunteer staff and church members who are talented and anointed, giving their full support with unity among us (HOP South bay). From this time on, we will our very best by the help of God to support the work of ministry here in USA and abroad. Last but not the least, please join us in prayer for more vision in the near future.
